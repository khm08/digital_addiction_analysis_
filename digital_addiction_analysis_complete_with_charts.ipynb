    "\n",
    "This analysis provides insights into the relationships between digital addiction and psychological well-being. Predictive models showed moderate accuracy, suggesting that while there is a relationship between digital usage and well-being, it is influenced by multiple factors. Inferential statistics identified significant differences in addiction scores across primary activities, and causal analysis highlighted key predictors of well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further research is needed to explore additional factors and more sophisticated modeling techniques to fully understand the impact of digital addiction on mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. **Predictive Models**: Random Forest and Decision Tree models provided insights into the impact of digital usage on well-being.\n",
    "2. **Significant Differences**: High addiction scores are associated with lower well-being.\n",
    "3. **Primary Activity Influence**: Different primary activities show varying levels of addiction and impact on well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "1. Promote awareness about healthy digital usage habits.\n",
    "2. Encourage further research to explore other factors influencing digital addiction.\n",
    "3. Develop interventions to manage digital addiction and improve psychological well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The results are based on simulated data, and real-world implications should be interpreted with caution.\n"
